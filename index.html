        <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
         <p>Graphic design is the art of visually communicating messages using images, text, and other elements. Designers create eye-catching visuals for print, digital media, advertising, and more, using layout, typography, and color theory. They play a vital role in shaping how information is presented and perceived, crafting designs that capture attention and convey ideas effectively.</p>
